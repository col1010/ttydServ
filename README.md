# ttydServ
ttydServ is a game server that hosts a text-based MMORPG inspired by Nintendo games "Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door" and the "Metroid Prime" series. It abides by the ["Lurk" Protocol](https://isoptera.lcsc.edu/~cmkauffman/lurk_project/lurk.html), as defined by Dr. Seth Long.

Information:

- Written for Linux systems in C and C++
- Over 60 rooms to explore containing over 100 characters and enemies to interact with
- Support for hundreds of players at once from all over the world
- Simple addition of extra content (rooms, enemies, non-playable characters, etc.) with straightforward JSON files
- Any client supporting the Lurk Protocol will be able to play on ttydServ, but it works especially well with my own client, [LURKMAN](https://github.com/col1010/LURKMAN)
- A custom wiki available detailing all features, enemies, rooms, etc. can be found [here](https://isoptera.lcsc.edu/~cmkauffman/wiki/home.html)
